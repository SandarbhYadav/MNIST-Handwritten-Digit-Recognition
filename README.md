# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Recognising handwritten digits of MNIST dataset by creating a Neural Network using numpy, scipy and matplotlib library only

The MNIST dataset is easily available on internet. The csv files of training set and test set should be downloaded and assigned in suitable folder before running the notebook file. For this project, I have used the MNIST dataset available on Google Colab.
